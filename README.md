# Pongpan_Ingpanuwong_test
A test for internship at Unit Co.Ltd.

Please refer to the following
- Answer 1 is the algorithm exam, it have two parts
    - assignment 1.1 Turtle walking, 
        A turtle starts at coordinate (0,0) on an N x N matrix and moves in zig-zag pattern starting from South to North alternating direction after each column until it passes through all elements.
    - assignment 1.2 Brick on the Wall
        Imagine you are walking along a wall, carrying a bag of bricks.
        At each step, look at the current wall height.
        -> If the wall is higher than your last placed brick, you must add bricks to reach
            the new height.
        -> If the wall is equal or lower, no bricks are needed, and you can continue
            walking.
- Answer 2 is the assignment 2 Mini Fullstack Project
    Making Todo App that user can
        -> List all todos
        -> Create new todo
        -> Update existing todo
        -> Delete a todo
    The website should have frontend and backend, backend is a RestAPI to manage data in any DB, and frontend will provide UI for it, with some customization per use preference.
    
    For me, this assignment is the introduction to fullstack development, every language is a new knowledge to me.
    I decide to use Go for backend language, and Flutter as frontend langauge because of the following
    1) Go is the backend language closest to C langauge, the langauge I use a lot when studying at 42Bangkok.
    2) Go can start pretty fast, faster than Python.
    3) Flutter have strong cross-platform, it can be use for Chrome, mobile phone app (both IOS or Android capable)
    4) Since I have to learn frontend from zero, I think Flutter could give me flexibility to work on mobile apps, which
        is prevalence right now.
