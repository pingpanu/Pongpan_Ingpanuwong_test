    The backend is written in Go language because I mainly use C language when study at 42Bangkok, and I shortly found that
    I'm really familiar with Go really fast
    The frontend is written in Flutter because I have zero experience on Frontend, and since we currently access web via
    website or App on mobile phone, the frontend language with cross-platform functionality would be useful for being a
    full-stack developer.
